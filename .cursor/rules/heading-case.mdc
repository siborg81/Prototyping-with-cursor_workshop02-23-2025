heading-case: All headings (h1, h2, h3, etc.) should use sentence case instead of title case. This means:
- Only capitalize the first letter of the heading and proper nouns
- Examples:
  ✓ "Component library" (not "Component Library")
  ✓ "Combined examples" (not "Combined Examples")
  ✓ "Button variants" (not "Button Variants")
- Exception: Product names and proper nouns should still be capitalized (e.g., "Getting started with Next.js")
