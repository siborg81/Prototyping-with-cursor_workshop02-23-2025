description: Creating a new prototype
globs:

When I ask you to...
- Create a new prototype
- Make a new prototype
- Create prototype
- Make prototype

Or any other language similar to this.

1. Always copy the "_template" directory in the "prototypes" directory. 
2. Always add the prototype to my homepage.

If I don't tell you what the prototype will be, ask me to name the prototype before proceeding with creating the prototype.
